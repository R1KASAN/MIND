# Specification Quality Checklist: Core Action Loop

> [ARCHIVAL] This document describes a historical pre-Gemma phase of MIND and is not the current runtime source of truth. Use [README.md](/Users/ark1/Public/MIND/README.md), [docs/demo-runbook.md](/Users/ark1/Public/MIND/docs/demo-runbook.md), and `npm run gate:phase5` for the active local workflow.

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All validation checks have passed successfully. The spec clearly outlines the "Core Action Loop" without delving into technical specifics, ensuring high testability and alignment with the required product vision.
